### ‚ÄºÔ∏è IMPORTANT! - _Note for iOS users_

  

  

Unfortunately, iOS users will not be able to preview the published app hosted on Expo. This issue is due to restrictions imposed by Apple and not by Expo itself.

  

  

Please refer to this Expo documentation link for further information on this restriction:

  

  

Link: https://docs.expo.io/workflow/publishing/#on-ios-you-cant-share-your-published

  

Due to the nature of this project objective being an educational and experimental one in learning more about working with React Native and the Expo framework in a production-like environment mimicking a professional workflow, this app isn't built for distributing officially to either the Play Store or the App Store.
